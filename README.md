UTM Care Charity Online Shop (UTMCCOS) is a final year project to replace the current system used by UTM students. UTMCCOS is proposed to allow users to purchase used items using a mobile app system because it is much easier to access. Using the current system is not efficient since the buyer must come to the seller to check the item and it depends on the availability or operating time. Next, there is always some mistake in terms of the miscalculated total price, stock, and items. The following existing system of UTM Care Charity Shop to perform donations can be made by UTM operator and students only. The limitation of people who can donate is limiting the fund to distribute to the people needed. The online mobile app system-based e-commerce platform is developed as an efficient system to sell the used item and increase the fund that everyone can access anytime and anywhere without worrying about the operating time and availability. This system requires knowledge using technology for user interface with great user experience, development frameworks, database, and backend hosting to help develop a mobile app system. This mobile app will have several main features which is to let the user login, view, purchase items. In conclusion, this mobile app system could give advantages and impact to both UTM Care operator and Students.
